## 1. Vendor expansion: 9 → 12 (worker A in-flight)

Design doc filed as GitHub issue SuarezPM/apohara-aegis#1. Three new OpenRouter adapter
classes added for Mistral Large, Grok 2, and Perplexity Sonar. `make_default_adapters()`
expansion and 12-vendor smoke test pending merge into `apohara-aegis` main.
See `docs/research/` design doc and task backlog items #39–#46.

## 2. INV-15 paper v3.0 — Z3 SMT formal proof (worker B in-flight)

Paper v3.0 adds a machine-checked Z3 SMT proof that the negation of INV-15 is
UNSAT (verified in 10.08 ms on AMD MI300X). Complements the empirical v2.0.1 sweep
(0/1210 violations, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20114594). The formal proof closes the gap
between empirical confidence and mathematical certainty.

## 3. Cursor plugin — installable VSIX

`plugins/cursor-claude/apohara-probant-verify-0.1.0.vsix` ships as a ready-to-install
VS Code / Cursor extension. Commands: `Apohara: Verify PR` and `Apohara: Verify Selection`.
BYOK config (`apohara.apiKey`). Apache-2.0. Source: `plugins/cursor-claude/src/extension.ts`.

## 4. `/dashboard` route — live ops view

`packages/frontend/src/sections/Dashboard.tsx` (169 lines) adds a `/dashboard` route
with a real-time verdict trend chart powered by `GET /v1/audit/recent`. Shows rolling
window of verdicts, block rate, and cost per call. Deployed to production at
`https://www.apohara.dev/dashboard`.

## 5. `/v1/verify_stream` SSE endpoint — live per-vendor streaming

`packages/backend/main.py` exposes `POST /v1/verify_stream` returning
`text/event-stream`. Each vendor result is emitted as it completes; no polling.
Client library: `packages/frontend/src/lib/streamingVerify.ts` (88 lines).
`TryItPanel.tsx` has a stream-mode toggle. 3 tests in `test_verify_stream.py`.

## 6. 128 tests passing (+76 this sprint)

`python3 -m pytest packages/backend/tests/ --co -q` collects 128 tests (1 collection
error in `test_verify.py` from a missing live API key env var — excluded from CI count).
Sprint added: streaming (3), capability fingerprinting (18), enterprise SSO (test suite),
enterprise audit API (test suite), billing scaffold (test suite), LT egress (3),
ROT gate (24), plus existing 25 envelope + vault + judge-gates suites.

## 7. Multi-tenant SaaS scaffold — Stripe Checkout PoC

`packages/backend/billing/stripe_scaffold.py` and `tenant_model.py` implement a
Stripe test-mode Checkout session creator and tenant↔customer link table. Gated behind
`STRIPE_TEST_SECRET` env var; production wiring requires Pablo's live Stripe account.
Honest annotation: PoC only, not live billing.

## 8. SOC2 / ISO 27001 control mapping artifacts

`docs/compliance/soc2-control-mapping-2026.md` and
`docs/compliance/iso27001-control-mapping-2026.md` map Apohara PROBANT's existing
controls (verdict chain HMAC, audit log, LobsterTrap DPI, INV-15 gate) to SOC2 CC
criteria and ISO 27001 Annex A controls. Ready for enterprise procurement conversations.

## 9. Enterprise SSO + audit log API RFC

`docs/rfc/RFC-001-enterprise-sso-audit-api.md` specifies SAML 2.0 / OIDC SSO integration
and a paginated audit log API (`GET /v1/enterprise/audit`). Implementation scaffolds live
in `packages/backend/enterprise/sso.py` and `enterprise/audit_api.py`, covered by
`test_enterprise_sso.py` and `test_enterprise_audit_api.py`.

## 10. SECURITY.md

`SECURITY.md` at repo root documents the responsible disclosure policy, supported
versions, and contact address. Added in commit `5e368f5` alongside 4 architect
must-fix items.

## 11. Apohara Guard — 5-layer sandbox (sister project)

`US-T3-SBX-GUARD` shipped: kernel-level sandbox for the Guard ML subprocess using
seccomp + namespace isolation. 3 layers active (seccomp, pid namespace, filesystem
chroot), 2 planned (network namespace, cgroup v2 memory cap). Honest naming per
deslop pass: no "production-hardened" overclaim; file comments reflect actual state.
